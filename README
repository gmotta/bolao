Just tried to setup everything on my mac, and while running the application I got some issues:

When I tried to install sqlite3 my mac asked for ruby 1.9.1 instead of 1.8.7 (current)

Trying to "workaround" on this, I installed sqlite3-ruby

After this when I tried to access localhost:3000/teams it is giving me one error: 
NameError in TeamsController#index

uninitialized constant ApplicationController
RAILS_ROOT: /Users/guilhermemotta/Work/Bolao

Any hints? Ideas? Help?
